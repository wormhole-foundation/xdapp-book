# Wormhole Typescript SDK

A Wormhole Typescript SDK provided for applications that only need to interact with the Core and Token Bridge contracts off-chain.

It can be installed using npm:

```sh
npm i @certusone/wormhole-sdk
```

The following sections will explain and provide examples of how to perform key functions with Wormhole using the Typescript SDK.

For more examples with a more exhaustive coverage of all the supported blockchains in Wormhole, be sure to check the [official codebase](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/tree/dev.v2/sdk/js) for the Typescript SDK.

Virtually all functions of the SDK are demonstrated in the [reference bridge UI](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/example-token-bridge-ui), which makes it an excellent source of example code as well.
