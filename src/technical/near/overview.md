# NEAR

The implementation contracts for Wormhole's official NEAR integration can be found [here](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/tree/main/near).

The deployed contract addresses can be found on the [Contracts page](../../reference/contracts.md).

NEAR is a rust-based programming environment. You'll likely find the [Wormhole Rust SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/tree/main/sdk/rust) useful.

The NEAR integration is also fully supported by the [Wormhole Typescript SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/tree/main/sdk/js).
